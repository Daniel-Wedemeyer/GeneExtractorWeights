#Adjust Gene Extractor Weights
In Vanilla Biotech, the Gene Extractor selects one to four genes based on a hardcoded formula that assigns genes with at least one complexity a weight of three, archite genes a weight of 0, and all other genes a weight of one. If adding a gene would push the genepack below -5 or above 5 metabolic rate, the gene is skipped.

This mod allows you to adjust the probabilities with which the Gene Extractor selects genes. You can enable extraction of Archite Genes, which is impossible in Vanilla, disable unwanted genes, or rebalance all 218 genes individually. You can also turn off the metabolic rate limiting, enabling the creation of gene packs that are impossible to implant on their own.

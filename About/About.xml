  <description>
	  In Vanilla Biotech, the Gene Extractor never extracts Archite Genes, and genes with at least one complexity are three times as likely to be extracted as no-complexity genes. If adding a gene would push the genepack below -5 or above 5 metabolic rate, the gene is removed from the pack.

	  This mod allows you to adjust the probabilities with which the Gene Extractor selects genes. You can enable extraction of Archite Genes, which is impossible in Vanilla, disable unwanted genes, or rebalance all 218 genes individually. You can also turn off the metabolic rate limit for genepack creation, allowing genepacks that are impossible to implant on their own.

	  This mod should be compatible with all mods that add new genes.
